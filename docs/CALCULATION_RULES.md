# Calculation Rules

This document will be the source of truth for landed-cost calculation rules once
they are designed and approved.

## Phase 1 — monetary precision foundation

These rules are approved and implemented (see `src/domain/monetary/` and
`src/domain/quantity/`). They govern *how numbers are represented and
combined*, not any landed-cost formula — no such formula exists yet.

- **No native `number` for financial arithmetic.** All monetary amounts
  (`Money`) and countable quantities (`Quantity`) are backed by
  [decimal.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js) exact decimal values,
  parsed from strings. `number`-based binary floating-point (`0.1 + 0.2 !==
  0.3`) is never the source of truth for a financial value.
- **Precision is kept high through intermediate calculation on purpose.**
  decimal.js is configured for 34 significant digits (`src/domain/monetary/decimal.ts`),
  comparable to IEEE 754 decimal128. This is intermediate *calculation*
  precision, not *display* precision — the two are kept conceptually and
  mechanically separate.
- **No rounding happens inside `Money`/`Quantity` arithmetic.** `add`,
  `subtract`, and `multiply` never round intermediate results. Rounding to a
  currency's minor-unit precision (e.g. 2dp for USD) is a decision that
  belongs to a specific calculation boundary (e.g. "the final landed total"),
  and will be defined explicitly when that calculation phase (Phase 2+) adds
  it here — not applied ad hoc at every intermediate step.
- **Display formatting is not domain logic.** How a `Money`/`Quantity` value
  is formatted for on-screen presentation (thousands separators, locale,
  trailing-zero padding) is a UI-layer concern; the domain layer only
  produces canonical exact decimal strings (`toDecimalString()` /
  `toJSON()`), never a formatted display string.
- **Currency safety is structural.** `Money` operations across two different
  currencies throw `CurrencyMismatchError` instead of producing a number —
  there is no implicit currency coercion anywhere in the domain layer.
- **Serialization is deterministic and explicit.** `Money`/`Quantity` never
  serialize decimal.js internals directly; they expose a plain JSON shape
  (canonical decimal string, via `.toFixed()`, which never uses exponential
  notation) as their persistence contract.

## Phase 2+ (not yet defined)

No calculation rules are defined or implemented yet for exchange rate
handling, MOQ/pack normalization, additional cost application (fixed,
percentage-based, freight, insurance, duty, brokerage, fees, local transport,
tax, discounts, surcharges), shared cost allocation, or incomplete-quote
detection. This file is a placeholder for those so future calculation-engine
phases (see [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), Phase 2 — Core
Calculation Engine and onward) have a known place to record approved,
reviewed financial rules, including the minor-unit rounding rule for final
totals referenced above.

Nothing beyond the Phase 1 section above should be treated as an implemented
or approved rule until a calculation phase explicitly adds it here.
